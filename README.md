# ol-comfy

Confortable and convenient Openlayers shortcuts for standard usage.

I've initially wrote this code for a project.
This code is "legacy" and next step will be to untangle it
to make it easier and lighter to implement, extend, ...
More comfy to use.

I'll also add some pieces for to draw with Openlayers.

Works already well, but please, wait a little bit before to use it.
