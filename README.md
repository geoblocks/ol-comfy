Comfortable and convenient Openlayers shortcuts for standard usage.

This library provides a good help to answer common Openlayers needs in a web application using web-components. Some features:

- Adds utils Openlayers functions
- Adds identifier to layer, interaction, control... to be able to retrieve it in every component.
- Add some observables.
- Simplify drawing (enable one tool at once, manage interactions).
- Not constraining architecture: takes only what you need, extends what you need.

I've initially written this code for a project. This code is "legacy" and next step will be to untangle it to make it easier and
lighter to implement, extend, ... More comfy to use.

Works already well, but please, wait a bit before to use it.
